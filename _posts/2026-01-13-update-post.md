I’m thrilled to kick off the year with a new publication from my postdoc at Harvard Medical School! 
It has been such an honor to being part of this incredible team doing truly cutting-edge work. Thank you, Shingo and Lijun, for allowing me to contribute to this amazing project.
Also, this marks my first publication in Science Magazine as 2nd author. A dream milestone in my trajectory as a researcher.
Here’s to many more! 🥂

*here's a short description by Shingo Kajimura himself:

Our body (cells) have fuel preference, e.g., burning fat vs. carbohydrates. The fuel selection highly depends on the environment and nutritional states – how do cells decide which fuels to use?  Our new study found that carnitine biosynthesis is crucial for fuel switching, enabling the body to burn fat during adaptation to fasting and cold exposure. To our surprise, the carnitine biosynthesis pathway influences the optimal efficacy of GLP1-based anti-obesity therapies!
