## About

I am a computational medicinal chemist with nearly ten years of academic and applied research experience in drug discovery. My work focuses on the integration of physics-based and data-driven methods to support hit identification, molecular optimization, structure–activity relationships, and mechanistic understanding of biological targets.

I have experience developing automated workflows and collaborating in interdisciplinary environments involving medicinal chemistry, structural biology, high-throughput screening, and natural products research. My research spans multiple therapeutic areas, including CNS disorders, metabolic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and inflammation.

I am currently based in Brazil, where I conduct research at the interface of computational chemistry and drug discovery, contributing to projects that bridge fundamental science and translational applications.
